Luhn's Algorithm, invented by Hans Peter Luhn, is a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, especially credit card numbers. The algorithm works as follows:



Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit), double the value of every second digit.

If doubling the digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from the result.

Sum all the digits together, including those that were not doubled.

If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0, the number is considered valid.

This method is widely used because it provides a quick way to verify the correctness of identification numbers, helping to catch common data entry errors.
